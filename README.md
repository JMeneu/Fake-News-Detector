## About 

In the era of information, misinformation proliferates at the same pace. Despite the evolution of humanity, our instincts to spread rumors and lies remain unchanged. As the old saying goes: lies spread faster than truth. Gossip seems to be inherent to human nature, and it can be difficult to combat.

To make matters worse, the abundance of data and speed of access to information, combined with the prevalence of click-bait content across news outlets, has only intensified the problem. It seems like this could turn into a never.ending vicious cycle, with devastating damage in society.

We refuse to accept this fate. In fact, we believe that some of the very same factors that have contributed to this information overload can also be leveraged to combat the pandemic of misinformation. 

Today, we introduce Factify: where facts meet AI.

Factify is an NLP-powered app designed to combat fake news. Built using Flask, this app uses advanced algorithms to classify news articles and other content as either real or fake. With Factify, you can empower yourself with accurate information and take control of the news you consume.
